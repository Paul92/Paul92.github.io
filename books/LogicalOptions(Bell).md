title: Logical Options
---

Regardless of the philosophical
[debate](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/think/article/mathematics-discovery-or-invention/D95CA7FFC636B147C9BD17F1409BAD36) on whether mathematics is discovered or invented, it remains
a deeply creative field. Everything in mathematics is constructed from the
ground up, from a very small set of assumptions. No matter if the interest is
towards an application or for a purely theoretical construct, the journey is
the same. The only limitation in this exploration is the truth: we cannot stray
away from a path of truthful statements.

Just as in a novel, the author builds a world with certain rules which cannot
be violated afterwards, the mathematics has its rules for ensuring we remain on
a path that leads to truth. Logic is the field which looks deep into the rules
of the mathematics, establishing what can be done and cannot be done.

*Logical Options: An introduction to classical and alternative logics* presents
a tour of various logics, building an understanding of the various possible
logical systems, along with their capabilities and limitations.
