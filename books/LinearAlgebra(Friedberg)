*Introduction*
Linear algebra is the subject that deals with linearity. This means lines, planes and other flat things in higher dimensions, and functions sending flat things to flat things. The key foundational concepts here are that of the vector space and that of the linear map. Most introductory linear algebra books treat the subject as purely computational. Finding way to compute things and leave it at that. For the mathematically inclined this is insufficient, as it doesn't show why it is true nor does it give deeper insight. This is why an axiomatic approach using vector spaces right away is preferable.

*Problem Selection*
Note: this is for fourth edition.

**Different tracks**
C: For those interested in computational problems
M: For those interested in pure math
P: For those interested in physics
A: For those interested in applications other than physics
F: For those interested in going through the material fast 

**Chapter 1: Vector Spaces**
***Section 1.1: Introduction***
This section is not essential for the rest of the book and is purely motivational. It can safely be skipped for those familiar to vectors in say physics or even high school.
