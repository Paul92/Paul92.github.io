# Introduction
Pinter will introduce the basic categories of abstract algebra: groups, rings and fields. The book works all the way to Galois Theory, which is proving that the quintic is not solvable using radicals. A lot of the good stuff is in the exercises, while the theory contains the bare essentials. This makes the book very close to a problem based course.
